  After my first 90 days in Zerocracy, I provide my opinion
  on its pros and cons.

90 days ago, I reported [a bug]() in Zerocracy, earning my first [+15]() points of reputation.
Today, the reward has disappeared as dictated by the Policy. I feel it's time to stop for a moment
and review my experience in Zerocracy.

<!--more-->

I'll start by saying that I love the idea behind Zerocracy. If properly realized, I think that it
can really be a game changer in software development, both for clients (by [cutting costs]()), and for developers (for making [paying by result]() a reality).

I've seen the ideas in practice by joining Zerocracy as a `DEV`. In these 90 days I've reached a peak reputation of a little over +400, divided as follows:

* I reported 8 bugs, each one worth +15 points
* I completed 9 jobs as a developer, each worth +35 points
* One code review (+15)
* One resume review (+32)
* 6 task refusals (-15 each)

All in all, I think I had some time to explore the system, and I reached an average score. In the future, I hope to reach +1024 and even start directing some projects in Zerocracy.
Now that I know the rules of the game (rules which I like), it will be easier to adapt to Zerocracy's workflow and get more things done. On the other hand, I feel that some of the reasons I couldn't get more points from the start are beyond my control, and that Zerocracy has some issues that need to be dealt with.
I will now list these positive and negative aspects, hoping to provide insight for beginners and outsiders with the first category, and to stimulate the growth of Zerocracy by raising attention to possible points of improvement with the second.

# Pros

## Quality is indeed exceptional
The structure of the workflow in Zerocracy guarantees that:
* each commit is linked to a specific issue: no hidden documentation, no gurus holding unwritten knowledge. Everything can be found in the ticket, where there is always the possibility to ask for more information
* multiple quality reviews are done on each line of code: `REV` and `ARC` both confirm that a given commit is good
* code formatting and organization is always close to being perfect: all build must pass strict automated quality checks, such as code indentation and class coupling
* tests are written along with code
* principles of [EO]() are applied

These properties, and many more, are a foundation for top-quality software that progresses in a rational way, avoiding spaghetti and shortcuts at all costs.

## Yes, refusing tasks is a good thing
I must confess, when I started working in Zerocracy I had both the [hacker]() and the [hero]() mentalities. I wanted to complete tasks at all costs: if something was not clear, it was my fault, I should read the docs better, maybe I missed something, I should debug the code until I figure what it is doing. I saw the opportunity of refusing tasks as a last resort, and a terrible stain on a developer's record ("How could he not be able to complete this?").
Additionally, I much preferred the bonus +30 points for completing a job, rather than the -15 for refusing it, even if this meant holding it for weeks because of impediments.

As time passed, I realized I was wrong on all the points. Now I know that:
* If something is not clear, there is no point in wasting time and hack my way to understanding. The documentation can always be improved, so I can open a ticket
* Even if I can't complete a task and refuse it for that reason, nobody cares. Reputation is agnostic of incompetence in a particular area, and I can make plenty of points where I am good
* Sometimes it makes no sense to occupy a slot in the agenda with a task for week, gaining +30 point in the end. Since the slots are limited, it is clear that quickly refusing a stale task can free up the space for many other

Besides individual considerations, I came to realize that task refusal is a big plus for overall project quality: since no one is ever forced to work on something they don't like/are not good at/did not understand, quality can only improve.
