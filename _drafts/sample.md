  After my first 90 days in Zerocracy, I provide my opinion
  on its pros and cons.

90 days ago, I reported [a bug]() in Zerocracy, earning my first [+15]() points of reputation.
Today, the reward has disappeared as dictated by the Policy. I feel it's time to stop for a moment
and review my experience in Zerocracy.

<!--more-->

I'll start by saying that I love the idea behind Zerocracy. If properly realized, I think that it
can really be a game changer in software development, both for clients (by [cutting costs]()), and for developers (for making [paying by result]() a reality).

I've seen the ideas in practice by joining Zerocracy as a `DEV`. In these 90 days I've reached a peak reputation of a little over +400, divided as follows:

* I reported 8 bugs, each one worth +15 points
* I completed 9 jobs as a developer, each worth +35 points
* One code review (+15)
* One resume review (+32)
* 6 task refusals (-15 each)

All in all, I think I had some time to explore the system, and I reached an average score. In the future, I hope to reach +1024 and even start directing some projects in Zerocracy.
Now that I know the rules of the game (rules which I like), it will be easier to adapt to Zerocracy's workflow and get more things done. On the other hand, I feel that some of the reasons I couldn't get more points from the start are beyond my control, and that Zerocracy has some issues that need to be dealt with.
I will now list these positive and negative aspects, hoping to provide insight for beginners and outsiders with the first category, and to stimulate the growth of Zerocracy by raising attention to possible points of improvement with the second.
